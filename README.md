Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, accounting for 1.59 million deaths in 2018. The majority of lung cancer cases are attributed to smoking, but exposure to air pollution is also a risk factor. A new study has found that air pollution may be linked to an increased risk of lung cancer, even in nonsmokers.
